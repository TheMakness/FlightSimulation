# Master's Thesis â€“ Impact of Assistance Systems in Flight Simulation - [Thesis File (fr)](https://github.com/TheMakness/FlightSimulation/blob/main/Memoire_LallementDamian.pdf)

This repository contains my **Master's thesis** on the impact of assistance systems in a flight simulation game for novice players.  

## Overview
The project investigates how different levels of assistance influence:  
- **Performance**  
- **Cognitive workload** (NASA-TLX)  
- **Perceived usability** (SUS)  

## Approach
By designing a **semi-realistic flight model**, setting up **experimental scenarios**, and analyzing **player data**, this work highlights the crucial role of **adaptive assistance** in improving accessibility and the user experience within complex interactive environments.
